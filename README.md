# map-sql

A Clojure library designed to provide SQL-like functions (and macros) for a data structure based on maps.
The library is designed to be used with the REPL.

## Install

With Leiningen:

``` clj
[map-sql "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

```clj
(require 'com.punkware.map-sql)

;create the database and return it.
(def mydb (create-db))

;add a new record with specified keys and values.
(insert mydb :name "my-name" :account "my-account" :code "12345")

;modify records based on where keys-values, having their specified value changed, or added, for the specified key.
(update mydb (where mydb :account "my-account") :code "54321")

;modify records based on where keys-values, having their specified key (and associated value) removed.
(delete-key mydb (where mydb :account "my-account") :code)

;modify records based on where keys-values, having their specified key renamed with new name.
(rename-key mydb (where mydb :account "my-account") :code :password)

;delete records based on where clause.
(delete mydb (where mydb :account "my-account"))

;where with fuzzy comparison
(where mydb :account "account")

;where with strict comparison
(where-strict mydb :account "my-account")

;display records selected by where keys-values, sorted by order-by clause. Display specified keys or all if none specified.
(display (where mydb :account "my-account") (order-by :name) :name :password)

;or with a more friedly syntax using the select macro:
(select :name :password from mydb where :account "my-account" order-by :name)

;other valid requests

;diplay all keys
(select from mydb where :account "my-account" order-by :name)

;no order-by defined, fuzzy comparison
(select from mydb where :account "my-account")

;no order-by defined, strict comparison
(select from mydb where-strict :account "my-account")

;filter on :account "my-account" OR :account "other-account"
(select from mydb where :account "my-account" :account "other-account")

;return the whole database
(select from mydb)
```

The database can then be saved to disk, load from disk with regular spit/slurp functions.
